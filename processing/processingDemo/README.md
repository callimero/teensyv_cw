# Vector drawing demo

This is a quick demo of how to use the Processing `Serial` class to
write to the v.st board on the serial port and draw vectors on the
Vectrex or vectorscope display.  There are a few different demos
included -- uncomment `qix_draw()`, `swarm_draw()` or `spiral_draw()`
to see the different patterns.

The recursive spiral art demo is by Jacob Joaquin and
demonstrates a class to create replicated shapes.
